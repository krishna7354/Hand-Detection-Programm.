# Libraries Used in Hand Detection Program

This program utilizes several important libraries for computer vision and hand tracking. Here's an overview of each:

## 1. OpenCV (cv2)

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.

### Key features used:
- Video capture from webcam
- Image processing operations
- Color space conversions

### Installation:

### Usage in our program:
- Capturing video frames
- Flipping the frame horizontally
- Converting color spaces from BGR to RGB

## 2. MediaPipe

MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.

### Key features used:
- Hand detection and tracking
- Drawing utilities for visualizing hand landmarks

### Installation:

### Usage in our program:
- Detecting hands in each frame
- Processing images to identify hand landmarks
- (Potentially) Drawing hand landmarks on the image

## 3. Time (Python standard library)

The time module provides various time-related functions.

### Key features used:
- Measuring execution time (if implemented)

### Installation:
No installation required (part of Python standard library)

### Usage in our program:
- Potentially used for calculating frame rates or timing operations

## Additional Notes

- OpenCV is used for the core image processing and video capture tasks.
- MediaPipe provides the hand detection model and utilities.
- The time module can be useful for performance measurements, though it's not explicitly used in the current code snippet.

When extending this program, you might consider using additional libraries such as:

- NumPy: For efficient array operations, which can be useful when working with image data.
- Matplotlib: For additional visualization options, especially during development and debugging.

Remember to keep your dependencies updated to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features and security patches.
