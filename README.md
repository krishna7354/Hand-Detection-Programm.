# Hand-Detection-Programm.

This program demonstrates real-time hand detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV in Python. It captures video from the default camera and processes each frame to detect and visualize hand landmarks.

## Key Features

- Real-time hand detection using webcam feed
- Utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking solution
- Flips the camera feed horizontally for a mirror-like effect
- Converts BGR color space to RGB for MediaPipe processing

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries:
